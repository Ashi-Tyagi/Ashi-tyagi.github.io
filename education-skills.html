        <h3>Significance</h3>
        <p>Through my academic coursework at Strawberry Crest High School, including higher-level IB classes in History, Physics, and English, along with standard-level classes in Computer Science, Analysis & Approaches, and Spanish, I have developed strong analytical, critical thinking, and communication skills. My dual enrollment courses at Hillsborough Community College, such as Financial Accounting, Computer Technology & Literacy, and Personal Skills for Business, have further strengthened my understanding of practical business concepts and financial operations.
          <br><br>These combined experiences directly support my international business career research project by providing the tools to analyze global markets, evaluate financial strategies, and assess the impact of cultural and economic factors on international trade. Additionally, my exposure to leadership roles and collaborative projects has enhanced my ability to communicate effectively across diverse teams, a key component of succeeding in global business environments.
          <br><br>By integrating both academic knowledge and real-world applications, I am able to explore international business practices, identify potential career pathways, and apply strategic thinking to solve complex problems in a global context. This approach demonstrates a clear connection between my education, skills, and the professional competencies required for a successful career in international business.</p>
